Instructions for setup:
***********************

-- Check out the code.

-- It is a maven project, so you will first need to install maven on your system.

-- The dependencies will be automatically downloaded. However, a few custom jars are
also part of the dependencies. These are included in the folder "customJars". You
can install them into your local maven repository following the guidelines in
customjars/README.

-- You should be able to open the project using eclipse directly, as it is checked
in as an eclipse project.

-- You may need to set the path to rt.jar in config.EqSQLConfig (copy rt.jar from
your JRE, typically located at JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/rt.jar into a location that is
readable, and set this path in config.EqSQLConfig).

-- Build to see there are no errors.

Instructions to run
*******************

-- A test is shown in dbridge.analysis.eqsql.EqSQLDriverTest that runs the test on
test cases from the Wilos project. We have made the Wilos project available along with
this project.

-- Users can try different programs by changing the case number in EqSQLDriverTest.
The function corresponding to the case number, as given in WilosRunConfig.java will
be rewritten.

-- The output file will be generated in the directory "sootOutput".


Note
*************
-- This project focuses only on rewriting a given function using SQL. In the
generated code, the rewritten function contains normal code. Other functions (unmodified
by our tool) will have functionally the same code, but more verbose. This is because
we currently generate the rewritten code by decompiling transformed bytecode.

-- The GUI integration of this project, which is part of a separate project,
contains code for restoring unmodified parts of the code, as well as rewriting an
entire file. Contact venkateshek@cse.iitb.ac.in for more details.



///////////////////// ******************************** Akash updates from previous 1 ****************************************************
Till prev the loop 8 worked fine but on running loop 4 there was infinite loop
The infinite loop was due to dfs using stack in resolveTree() in Utils.java
They did not maintained any visited list for the dfs using stack.
I added the visited the list and corrected the DFS traversal.
Now Loop4 infinite loop problem is solved.
Still need to check the results of loop summarization
//////////////////////// ************************************************************************************************///////////////////////////////////

Loop8 inlining of primitive fields is handled properlyas per thesis.
First primitive fields of iterator which are present are collected in SIRLoopRegionAnalyzer and stored in static variable using
LoopIteratorCollectionHandler.changedLoopFieldsMap.put(vn, bodyVEMap.get(vn));
Then in DIRSequentialRegionAnalyzerN.java if(iterator != null) {} was filled with my code where I identified the veMap which has to be updated
(owner.pets) in this case and then called LoopIteratorCollectionHandler.replacePrimitives(toReplaceVeMap, changedKey, changedVEMap) to perform the inlining
of the primitive fields of the iterator.

//////////////////////////// *****************************************************************************************////////////////////////////////

Loop8 inlining of pet.visits entity field is done in same was primitives were done, so will work only till the first level.
handled using replaceEntity(Node toReplaceVeMap, Node changedKey, Node toInlineVEMap) in LoopIteratorCollectionHandler.java
TODO:  Multiple levels needs to be handled by writing separate code in replaceEntity(). Use the concept of depth using the '.' to identify depth.
TODO:  like pet.owner.id is a 2 level field and so change in this has to handled by entering first the listNode of pet and then the listNode of pet.owner.
TODO:  then on the id fields just replace the child with the value of veMap that has to be inlined.
